# OGP

This Optical pickup is being designed so that it can be used on any string instrument while being minimally intrusive and remaing flexible.
It has a differential sensor array for each string, each with it's own circuit board. The IR LEDs are modulated at 500khz. The Demodulation boards are designed to
reject all other signals except the 500khz differential signal from the sensors in order to reject environment noise. 
Additionally, an IR passthrough filter over the sensors may be added for further noise rejection, or a beveled cover may be added over the top of the strings.
This cover needs to absorb and deflect all light coming from the IR LEDs as well because the circuit relies on no refleced light 
coming back to the sensors except what is being reflected by the strings. It needs to be a light trap on the inside of some sort.

This design is still being tested and refined.
If you have any ideas, or are more experenced in electronics, or if you see flaws in my design please feel free to reach out to me or modify the circuit to your will.
Music should be free for anyone to make and therfore I'm providing this circuit FREE for anyone to build, BUT NOT TO SELL, 
and without any warranty that this circuit will work for your needs or work at all.

It's my design, give credit where it's due. Thank you. 
I am intested in hearing any and all feedback about this circuit and any interesting applications it's been fitted to. ;-)
